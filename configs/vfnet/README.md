## Abstract

Accurately ranking the vast number of candidate detections is crucial for dense object detectors to achieve high performance. Prior work uses the classification score or a combination of classification and predicted localization scores to rank candidates. However, neither option results in a reliable ranking, thus degrading detection performance. In this paper, we propose to learn an Iou-aware Classification Score (IACS) as a joint representation of object presence confidence and localization accuracy. We show that dense object detectors can achieve a more accurate ranking of candidate detections based on the IACS. We design a new loss function, named Varifocal Loss, to train a dense object detector to predict the IACS, and propose a new star-shaped bounding box feature representation for IACS prediction and bounding box refinement. Combining these two new components and a bounding box refinement branch, we build an IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture, that we call VarifocalNet or VFNet for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong baseline by âˆ¼2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best model VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN achieves a single-model single-scale AP of 55.1 on COCO test-dev, which is state-of-the-art among various object detectors.

## Introduction

**VarifocalNet (VFNet)** learns to predict the IoU-aware classification score which mixes the object presence confidence and localization accuracy together as the detection score for a bounding box. The learning is supervised by the proposed Varifocal Loss (VFL), based on a new star-shaped bounding box feature representation (the features at nine yellow sampling points). Given the new representation, the object localization accuracy is further improved by refining the initially regressed bounding box.
